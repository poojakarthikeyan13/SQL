SQL JOIN:
=========
->A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Different Types of SQL JOINs:
============================
1)(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2)LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3)RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4)FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

SQL INNER JOIN Keyword:
======================
->The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.

INNER JOIN Syntax:
------------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SQL LEFT JOIN Keyword:
=====================
->The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table (table1), and the matched records from the right table (table2). The result is NULL from the right side, if there is no match.

LEFT JOIN Syntax:
-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
Note: In some databases LEFT JOIN is called LEFT OUTER JOIN.

SQL RIGHT JOIN Keyword:
=======================
->The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.

RIGHT JOIN Syntax:
------------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;

SQL FULL OUTER JOIN Keyword:
============================
->The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.

Note: FULL OUTER JOIN can potentially return very large result-sets!

Tip: FULL OUTER JOIN and FULL JOIN are the same.

FULL OUTER JOIN Syntax:
----------------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
WHERE condition;

SQL Self JOIN:
==============
->A self JOIN is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.

Self JOIN Syntax:
-----------------
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition;
